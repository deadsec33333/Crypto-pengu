										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms has significantly expanded its BTC holdings. As of December 12, it acquired 5,117 BTC for $510 million. This purchase, at an average price of $99,669 per Bitcoin, brings Riot&#8217;s total holdings to 16,728 BTC.</strong></p>



<p>The acquisition was funded through proceeds from the company&#8217;s 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2030 and existing cash reserves.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-riot-s-bitcoin-holdings-reach-16-728-btc">Riot’s Bitcoin Holdings Reach 16,728 BTC</h2>



<p>Riot’s recent Bitcoin <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1167419/000155837024016217/riot-20241213x8k.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">acquisition</a> reflects a broader trend of treating the largest cryptocurrency as a strategic reserve asset. This strategy aligns with recent market plays made by other companies and governments recently. </p>



<p>MicroStrategy, a pioneer in using Bitcoin as a corporate treasury reserve, currently holds over 423,650 BTC. Since November, the firm has made <a href="https://beincrypto.com/microstrategy-bitcoin-purchase-2-1-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over $15 billion worth</a> of BTC purchases. </p>



<p>Similarly, Marathon Digital has <a href="https://beincrypto.com/marathon-digital-buys-more-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accumulated 40,435 BTC,</a> positioning itself as another leader in the mining and holding of digital assets.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="955" height="632" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-93.png" alt="Public Companies With Most Bitcoin Holdings" class="wp-image-628437" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-93.png 955w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-93-360x238.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-93-850x563.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-93-768x508.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-93-150x99.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 955px) 100vw, 955px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Public Companies With Most Bitcoin Holdings. Source: <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/public-companies-bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoinGecko</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Governments are also exploring Bitcoin as a reserve currency. Pennsylvania introduced the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/pennsylvania-proposes-bitcoin-reserve-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act,</a> which proposes allocating up to 10% of its $7 billion state funds to Bitcoin. </p>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/texas-bitcoin-reserve-capriglione/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Texas is considering</a> legislation to allow tax payments in Bitcoin, while Bhutan has been quietly mining Bitcoin since 2019, amassing over 12,000 BTC. Just this week, the city of Vancouver passed a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/vancouver-council-embraces-bitcoin-reserve-proposal/">Bitcoin reserve proposal, </a>and a Russian lawmaker filed for a similar <a href="https://beincrypto.com/russia-strategic-bitcoin-reserve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposal in Moscow.</a></p>



<p>These examples illustrate a growing confidence in Bitcoin’s ability to serve as a store of value and an inflation hedge. A 2024 study suggests that there is empirical evidence supporting this notion, but as adoption increases, its store of value may dwindle.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;The results, based on monthly data between August 2010 and January 2023, indicate that bitcoin returns increase significantly after a positive inflationary shock, corroborating empirical evidence that Bitcoin can act as an inflation hedge. However, we observe that bitcoin’s inflationary hedging property is sensitive to the price index – it only holds for CPI shocks – and to the period of analysis — the hedging property stems primarily from sample periods before the increasing institutional adoption of BTC (“early days”). Thus, the inflation-hedging property of Bitcoin is context-specific and is likely to be diminishing as adoption increases.&#8221; <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4763347" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a> researcher Harold Rodriguez.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nonetheless, Riot Platforms’ decision to dedicate substantial resources to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/bitcoin-price-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin holdings</a> signals confidence in the cryptocurrency’s future and its strategic alignment with a global shift toward digital reserve assets.</p>



<p>In a closely related development, activist investor Starboard Value has acquired a significant stake in Riot Platforms. Starboard is advocating for Riot to repurpose some of its <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/bitcoin-mining-from-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin mining</a> facilities into hyperscale data centers to serve large-scale computing clients. </p>



<p>Riot has acknowledged ongoing discussions with Starboard, noting their work on enhancing shareholder value.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>AMP Limited, an Australian pension and wealth fund, invested approximately $17.2 million into Bitcoin futures. The firm has no plans to make further investments at this time.  </strong></p>



<p>Although Coinbase has deliberately courted Australia&#8217;s pension funds, the national industry has shown little interest in Bitcoin investment.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-amp-puts-bitcoin-in-pensions">AMP Puts Bitcoin in Pensions</h2>



<p>Although Coinbase has made deliberate efforts to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/coinbase-targets-australia-pension-funds-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">court Australian pension fund investment</a> this year, the sector previously showed little interest. However, AMP’s Chief Investment Officer Anna Shelley claimed that &#8220;structural changes&#8221; like the ETFs have changed the calculation.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Following testing and careful consideration by our investment team and committee, we included a small and risk-controlled position in digital assets through our Dynamic Asset Allocation program in May,&#8221; Shelley claimed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-13/australian-pension-fund-reveals-rare-wager-on-bitcoin-btc-futures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reports</a>, AMP exposed approximately 0.5% of its pension assets to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/trade-bitcoin-futures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin futures</a>. <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">This sector was a deliberate target in the struggle to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approve a Bitcoin ETF</a></span> in Australia. However, the AMP is now acknowledging that <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/retirement-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crypto can be useful for retirement funds</a> due to its use as an inflation hedge,</p>



<p>Although Shelley claimed that Australia&#8217;s ETF approvals were the impetus for this investment, it&#8217;s not clear that this was AMP&#8217;s main investment vehicle. Granted, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-etf-gain-further-exposure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Australia has been a booming market</a> for Bitcoin ETFs. Still, that&#8217;s no guarantee: although the nation&#8217;s pension funds have shown little crypto interest, its <a href="https://beincrypto.com/australian-pension-invest-data-centers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest one invested heavily in AI last year</a>. </p>



<p>In any event, pension investment is growing and has a noticeable impact on the Bitcoin ETF market. Michigan&#8217;s largest fund allocated $6.6 million to Bitcoin ETFs, which was followed by <a href="https://beincrypto.com/michigan-pension-fund-buys-ethereum-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a larger Ethereum investment</a> months later. Additionally, South Korea&#8217;s National Pension Service <a href="https://beincrypto.com/south-korea-nps-microstrategy-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">put $34 million into MicroStrategy</a>, a more indirect method of Bitcoin exposure.</p>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoins-rise-likely-as-profits-await/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin has been performing well</a> lately, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/coinshares-forecasts-strong-2025-for-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with strong forward momentum</a>. If AMP receives a good return on its investment, it may inspire more interest throughout the sector. For now, however, this pension fund&#8217;s Bitcoin futures investment is a rarity, at least in the Australian market. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the country has been focusing extensively on crypto regulations lately. Earlier this month, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/austrac-crackdown-crypto-atms-australia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AUSTRAC intensified investigations into crypto ATMs</a>, alleging these operations have been increasingly facilitating cybercrime and money laundering. </p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Cardano (ADA) has surged over 100% in the past 30 days but has declined nearly 4% in the last week, indicating short-term selling pressure.</strong></p>



<p>The sharp correction from December 7 to December 10 has eased, with ADA&#8217;s Average Directional Index (ADX) dropping to 21.4, signaling weakening trend strength. However, renewed whale accumulation suggests that large holders are positioning for a potential recovery.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-cardano-strong-downtrend-just-faded-away">Cardano Strong Downtrend Just Faded Away</h2>



<p>Between December 7 and December 10, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ada-increase-heads-toward-dead-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ADA price</a> experienced a sharp correction, dropping 23% as its Average Directional Index (ADX) spiked to 45, signaling a strong downtrend. </p>



<p>However, this momentum has eased, and ADA’s ADX now stands at 21.4, reflecting a significant loss in trend strength.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="2622" height="538" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-13-at-10.31.38.png" alt="ADA ADX." class="wp-image-628264" style="aspect-ratio:4.816849816849817;width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-13-at-10.31.38.png 2622w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-13-at-10.31.38-360x74.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-13-at-10.31.38-850x174.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-13-at-10.31.38-768x158.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-13-at-10.31.38-1536x315.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-13-at-10.31.38-2048x420.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-13-at-10.31.38-150x31.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2622px) 100vw, 2622px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">ADA ADX. Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The ADX measures the strength of a trend, with values above 25 indicating a strong trend and values below 20 suggesting a lack of a clear direction. With <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ada-coin-price-remain-below-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ADA</a> ADX at 21.4, it sits in a neutral zone, pointing to consolidation. </p>



<p>This indicates that the previous downtrend has subsided, but no strong upward or downward trend has emerged, leaving ADA’s price movement uncertain in the near term.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-ada-whales-are-accumulating-again">ADA Whales Are Accumulating Again</h2>



<p>Between December 7 and December 10, the number of wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million <a href="https://beincrypto.com/cardano-ada-price-slumps-below-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ADA</a> fell sharply from 406 to 400, marking the lowest level since November 11. </p>



<p>This decline suggests that large holders were reducing their positions during the correction.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="3840" height="1300" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cardano-ADA-10.32.31-13-Dec-2024.png" alt="Addresses Holding Between 10 Million and 100 Million ADA." class="wp-image-628265" style="aspect-ratio:2.953846153846154;width:1025px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cardano-ADA-10.32.31-13-Dec-2024.png 3840w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cardano-ADA-10.32.31-13-Dec-2024-360x122.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cardano-ADA-10.32.31-13-Dec-2024-850x288.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cardano-ADA-10.32.31-13-Dec-2024-768x260.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cardano-ADA-10.32.31-13-Dec-2024-1536x520.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cardano-ADA-10.32.31-13-Dec-2024-2048x693.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Cardano-ADA-10.32.31-13-Dec-2024-150x51.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Addresses Holding Between 10 Million and 100 Million ADA. Source: <a href="https://app.santiment.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Santiment</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Tracking whale activity is crucial as these large holders often drive significant price movements through their buying or selling decisions. Interestingly, after the sharp decline, the number of wallets in this category has rebounded, now sitting at 405. </p>



<p>This resurgence could indicate renewed confidence among major holders. That could signal potential price stability or even a recovery for <a href="https://beincrypto.com/cardano-price-unfazed-despite-facing-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ADA price</a> in the near term.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-ada-price-prediction-will-it-go-back-to-1-20">ADA Price Prediction: Will It Go Back to $1.20?</h2>



<p>After losing the $1.15 support, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/cardano-price-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardano price</a> dropped to $1.10. Its EMA lines indicate the absence of a strong trend, as three of them are trading very close to each other. </p>



<p>With the ADX now at 21, the strength of the recent correction appears to have diminished. That suggests that ADA may be entering a consolidation phase.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2710" height="1290" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ADAUSDT_2024-12-13_10-31-18.png" alt="ADA Price Analysis." class="wp-image-628267" style="aspect-ratio:2.0910493827160495;width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ADAUSDT_2024-12-13_10-31-18.png 2710w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ADAUSDT_2024-12-13_10-31-18-360x171.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ADAUSDT_2024-12-13_10-31-18-850x405.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ADAUSDT_2024-12-13_10-31-18-768x366.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ADAUSDT_2024-12-13_10-31-18-1536x731.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ADAUSDT_2024-12-13_10-31-18-2048x975.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ADAUSDT_2024-12-13_10-31-18-150x71.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2710px) 100vw, 2710px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">ADA Price Analysis.

<p>If a new downtrend emerges, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/is-cardano-ada-in-danger-of-being-overvalued/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ADA price</a> could test the $1.03 support. A failure to hold that level might push it further down to $0.87. On the upside, whale accumulation has resumed, signaling potential anticipation of a recovery. </p>



<p>Should <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/charles-hoskinson-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardano</a> rebound, it could test the resistance at $1.24, with the possibility of reaching $1.32 if that level is broken.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>This week’s top-performing AI coins with a market cap above $100 million include ParallelAI (PAI), VIRTUAL Protocol (VIRTUAL), and TARS Protocol (TAI). ParallelAI gained 35% over the last seven days, driven by its advanced parallel processing platform, while its market cap now stands at $325 million. </strong></p>



<p>VIRTUAL Protocol, the leading decentralized platform for AI personas, surged 27% this week and over 500% in the last month, boasting a market cap of $450 million. Meanwhile, TARS Protocol, focusing on modular AI and Web3 infrastructure, saw a 26% weekly gain and surpassed a $200 million market cap, solidifying its position within the Solana ecosystem.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-parallelai-pai">ParallelAI (PAI)</h2>



<p>ParallelAI (PAI) is an <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-invest-ai-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">artificial intelligence</a> computing platform designed to handle complex tasks efficiently. It uses parallel processing with multiple CPUs and GPUs to boost performance and speed.</p>



<p>This week, PAI reached a new all-time high, climbing 35% in just seven days. </p>

<p>Its RSI stands at 62, down from over 70 yesterday, indicating the recent rally has cooled slightly. If the positive momentum continues, PAI may break above $1.20 and even approach $1.50. </p>



<p>On the downside, strong support lies at $0.81, but a break below that could see it drop as low as $0.53. That would mark a potential 47% correction for the AI coin.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-virtual-protocol-virtual">Virtual Protocol (VIRTUAL)</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/virtual-surges-to-all-time-high/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VIRTUAL</a> Protocol is a decentralized platform that powers the creation and monetization of artificial intelligence personas for virtual spaces like games and metaverses. </p>



<p>It has emerged as the leading platform for <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ai-crypto-agents-leader-virtual-sees-price-surge-slow-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI crypto agents</a>, gaining considerable traction in recent weeks. Last week, it surpassed other AI coins in market capitalization, overtaking competitors such as AKASH, GRASS, and AIOZ.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2710" height="1290" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/VIRTUALUSDT_2024-12-13_09-10-51.png" alt="VIRTUAL Price Analysis." class="wp-image-628137" style="width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/VIRTUALUSDT_2024-12-13_09-10-51.png 2710w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/VIRTUALUSDT_2024-12-13_09-10-51-360x171.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/VIRTUALUSDT_2024-12-13_09-10-51-850x405.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/VIRTUALUSDT_2024-12-13_09-10-51-768x366.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/VIRTUALUSDT_2024-12-13_09-10-51-1536x731.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/VIRTUALUSDT_2024-12-13_09-10-51-2048x975.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/VIRTUALUSDT_2024-12-13_09-10-51-150x71.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2710px) 100vw, 2710px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">VIRTUAL Price Analysis.

<p>Built on the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/base-network-rules-out-token-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Base</a> ecosystem, VIRTUAL has surged nearly 27% in the past seven days and over 500% in the last 30 days, hitting a new all-time high on December 13. </p>



<p>If the current momentum persists, it could climb to $3 by the end of December, offering a 30% upside. On the downside, if interest in crypto AI agents fades, VIRTUAL might test strong support at $1.99, with a potential drop to $1.35 if that level breaks.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-tars-protocol-tai">TARS Protocol (TAI)</h2>



<p>TARS Protocol is a modular infrastructure platform that bridges artificial intelligence and Web3 technologies. Designed for <a href="https://beincrypto.com/trumps-eyes-ai-czar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI and Blockchain-as-a-Service</a> projects, it simplifies the transition from Web2 to Web3 with a suite of tools and services.</p>



<p>Recently, TARS crossed a $200 million market cap and hit an all-time high. It&#8217;s currently one of the leading AI coins in the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/solana-sellers-dictate-price-movement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solana</a> ecosystem. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2710" height="1290" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TAIUSDT_2024-12-13_09-11-25.png" alt="TAI Price Analysis." class="wp-image-628139" style="aspect-ratio:2.0910493827160495;width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TAIUSDT_2024-12-13_09-11-25.png 2710w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TAIUSDT_2024-12-13_09-11-25-360x171.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TAIUSDT_2024-12-13_09-11-25-850x405.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TAIUSDT_2024-12-13_09-11-25-768x366.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TAIUSDT_2024-12-13_09-11-25-1536x731.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TAIUSDT_2024-12-13_09-11-25-2048x975.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TAIUSDT_2024-12-13_09-11-25-150x71.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2710px) 100vw, 2710px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">TAI Price Analysis.

<p>Its price jumped over 26% in the past seven days and over 230% in the last 30 days. If the uptrend continues, TARS could break above $0.50 and potentially reach $0.75 or even $1 soon. </p>



<p>On the downside, a correction could push it toward $0.42, with a further drop to $0.31 if that support fails.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin’s 26,931.1% 10-year return highlights its role as a high-growth asset, but CoinGecko stresses diversification for balanced investing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>A new CoinGecko report </strong><span style="margin: 0px;padding: 0px"><strong>shows that</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Bitcoin has</strong></span><strong> outperformed traditional investment assets over the past decade, establishing itself as one of the most promising investment prospects. </strong></p>



<p>The report reveals Bitcoin’s unmatched returns compared to gold, stocks, and US Treasury bonds.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-is-changing-the-investment-market">Bitcoin is Changing the Investment Market</h2>



<p>Back in 2014, if someone had <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/best-crypto-exchange-usa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">invested $100 in Bitcoin</a>, it would now be worth approximately $26,931. This is a remarkable 27,000% return. </p>



<p>By contrast, the same investment in the S&amp;P 500 index would yield 193.3%, while gold would provide 125.8%, and 10-year US Treasuries would deliver 86.8%.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="996" height="354" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-92.png" alt="" class="wp-image-628399" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-92.png 996w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-92-360x128.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-92-850x302.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-92-768x273.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-92-150x53.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bitcoin Vs Traditional Assets in the Past 10 Years. Source: <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/bitcoin-versus-traditional-assets-price-returns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoinGecko</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The annual return of Bitcoin is also significant compared to these assets. BTC has <a href="https://beincrypto.com/us-treasury-recognizes-bitcoin-as-digital-gold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">held onto its momentum</a> in 2024, delivering a year-to-date return of 129%. This <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-market-cap-all-time-high/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performance surpasses</a> gold, which rose by 32.2%, and the S&amp;P 500, which gained 28.3%. Analysts attribute <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoins-rise-likely-as-profits-await/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin’s gains</a> to growing institutional interest and favorable macroeconomic trends.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;This decade-long view reveals Bitcoin as the ultimate high-growth asset, with gold, bonds, and equities providing safer, lower-return alternatives for risk-averse investors. However, Bitcoin was still a relatively new asset, with a significantly smaller market cap than other assets. This smaller base enabled it to grow at a much quicker pace,&#8221; the report <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/bitcoin-versus-traditional-assets-price-returns?utm_campaign=Data%20Visualization&amp;utm_source=beincrypto&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, the report notes that bonds have performed well over medium-term horizons. Over the past three years, five-year US Treasuries delivered a 267.8% return. Meanwhile, 10-year Treasuries achieved a 218.0% gain. These figures highlight bonds as a stable choice during periods of economic steadiness.</p>



<p>While Bitcoin offers unmatched growth potential, its volatility poses risks. These findings highlight the importance of portfolio diversification. Traditional investments, such as bonds and stocks, can provide stability for risk-averse investors. Even investment management giant <a href="https://beincrypto.com/blackrock-bitcoin-portfolio-allocation/">BlackRock suggests allocating up to 2% of portfolios to Bitcoin</a>. </p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Bitcoin’s rewards are unmatched, but its risks are significant. Diversification across asset classes remains essential for long-term success,&#8221; the report <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/bitcoin-versus-traditional-assets-price-returns?utm_campaign=Data%20Visualization&amp;utm_source=beincrypto&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Investors are encouraged to weigh Bitcoin’s high-risk, high-reward nature against more predictable asset classes. This approach can help mitigate losses while capitalizing on Bitcoin’s growth.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://beincrypto.com/blackrock-bitcoin-portfolio-allocation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin integrates</a> further into global financial systems, its role evolves. Investors must carefully assess how much risk they are willing to take for potentially <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/who-owns-the-most-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extraordinary returns. </a>One thing is for certain: this report&#8217;s evidence of Bitcoin’s position as a cornerstone of modern investment strategies is undeniable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Iran has faced major power blackouts in its capital, Tehran, and neighboring provinces throughout October and November. While officials cite various causes, crypto mining has emerged as a significant contributor to the power crisis.</strong></p>



<p>With the lowest estimated cost of mining in the world, many miners exploit Iran&#8217;s heavily government-subsidized electricity.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-iran-s-subsidized-electricity-drives-bitcoin-mining-boom">Iran&#8217;s <strong>Subsidized Electricity Drives Bitcoin Mining Boom</strong></h2>



<p>Iran&#8217;s heavily subsidized electricity rates have made it a global <a href="https://beincrypto.com/crypto-mining-to-resume-in-iran-but-with-conditions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hotspot for Bitcoin mining</a> since 2022. Electricity in Iran costs just $0.002 per kilowatt-hour, the lowest in the world by a huge margin. This low cost has attracted miners, as electricity accounts for the majority of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/is-crypto-mining-profitable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin mining expenses.</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1440" height="672" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-13-at-3.27.38 PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-628250" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-13-at-3.27.38 PM.png 1440w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-13-at-3.27.38 PM-360x168.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-13-at-3.27.38 PM-850x397.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-13-at-3.27.38 PM-768x358.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-13-at-3.27.38 PM-150x70.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lowest Electricity Prices Globally, 2024.

<p>At the time of writing, the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/free-bitcoin-without-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost of mining one Bitcoin</a> in Iran stood at $1,324, dramatically lower than the $100,000 in the United States or $300,000 in Ireland. </p>



<p>In August, the CEO of Iran’s state electricity company, Tavanir, highlighted the impact of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/iran-continues-clamp-down-on-illegal-crypto-mining/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unauthorized mining operations</a> on the region&#8217;s power grid. The power used by 230,000 unlicensed devices is equivalent to the total electricity demand of Markazi province, a key manufacturing hub. </p>



<p>In response, Tehran introduced a bounty to incentivize citizens to report any unlicensed crypto-mining equipment.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote">
<p>&#8220;Opportunistic individuals have been exploiting subsidized electricity and public networks to mine cryptocurrencies without proper authorization. This unauthorized mining has led to an abnormal surge in electricity consumption, causing significant disruptions and problems within the country&#8217;s power grid,&#8221; <a href="https://www.iranintl.com/en/202408135616" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> Mostafa Rajabi Mashhadi, CEO of Tavanir, to local news.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Public frustration has grown, with Iranians sharing insights into previously uncovered mining farms on social media. Many of these operations are typically discovered in government-aided areas, like mosques or schools. These institutes generally receive discounted or free electricity.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-sanctions-moving-tehran-towards-crypto">Sanctions <strong>Moving Tehran Towards Crypto</strong></h2>



<p>Last week, the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) <a href="https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/507174/Central-bank-approves-regulatory-framework-for-cryptocurrencies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">approved</a> a new regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. The policy mandates licensing for crypto brokers and custodians, ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) laws, counter-terrorism financing (CTF) rules, and tax obligations.</p>



<p>In recent times, Iran has played a broader role in the crypto market, with geopolitical tensions often spilling over to the industry. Earlier this year, the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-dips-israel-iran-conflict/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Israel-Iran conflict had a notable impact</a> on Bitcoin&#8217;s market price. The tense conflict back in April saw nearly <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-crypto-market-recover-iran-israel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1 billion liquidated</a> from the crypto market. However, prices recovered rather quickly. </p>



<p>Also, Iran has <a href="https://beincrypto.com/iran-and-russia-to-launch-a-stablecoin-backed-by-gold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">embraced cryptocurrency</a> as a tool to mitigate economic challenges and <a href="https://beincrypto.com/iran-avoid-import-sanctions-new-crypto-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">circumvent US sanctions</a> that restrict access to global financial networks. The government has permitted regulated crypto mining to generate revenue and is exploring using digital currencies for <a href="https://beincrypto.com/brics-summit-2024-de-dollarization-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">international trade settlements.</a></p>



<p>Although officials have not directly linked Bitcoin mining to recent outages, the public has drawn connections. Iran’s dual approach of exploring crypto while combating unauthorized mining reflects the sector’s complex role in the nation’s economy. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Ethereum (ETH) price is showing mixed signals as it trades between a key resistance at $4,100 and support at $3,600. Recent metrics, including NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss), indicate improving investor sentiment, and ETH remains far from the &#8220;Euphoria &#8211; Greed&#8221; stage seen at market tops. </strong></p>



<p>Whale activity has also slowed after a significant accumulation phase earlier in November, suggesting a possible consolidation period. These factors together highlight both the potential for a new all-time high before Christmas and the risks of a correction in the short term.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-eth-is-far-from-euphoria-and-this-could-mean-a-lot-of-things">ETH Is Far from Euphoria — And This Could Mean a Lot Of Things</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-tvl-increases-surpasses-solana-tron/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a> NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss) is currently at 0.52, rising from 0.49 just three days ago. This metric, which reflects the overall unrealized profit or loss of holders, has moved Ethereum from the &#8220;Optimism &#8211; Anxiety&#8221; stage to the &#8220;Belief &#8211; Denial&#8221; stage. </p>



<p>NUPL values offer insights into market sentiment, with higher values suggesting increasing confidence and profitability among investors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized is-style-default"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1800" height="1013" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/glassnode-studio_net-unrealized-profit-loss-nupl-1.png" alt="ETH NUPL." class="wp-image-628193" style="aspect-ratio:1.7777777777777777;object-fit:cover;width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/glassnode-studio_net-unrealized-profit-loss-nupl-1.png 1800w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/glassnode-studio_net-unrealized-profit-loss-nupl-1-360x203.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/glassnode-studio_net-unrealized-profit-loss-nupl-1-850x478.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/glassnode-studio_net-unrealized-profit-loss-nupl-1-768x432.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/glassnode-studio_net-unrealized-profit-loss-nupl-1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/glassnode-studio_net-unrealized-profit-loss-nupl-1-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">ETH NUPL. Source: <a href="https://glassnode.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Glassnode</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite this improvement, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-price-high-as-whales-increase-accumulation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a> NUPL remains far from the &#8220;Euphoria &#8211; Greed&#8221; stage, which typically occurs around a NUPL value of 0.75. </p>



<p>This indicates that while investor sentiment is improving, it has yet to reach the levels of overconfidence associated with market tops. For ETH&#8217;s price, this suggests room for further growth as sentiment strengthens, but it also highlights the absence of extreme optimism.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-eth-whales-accumulated-a-lot-last-week-but-now-the-pace-decreased">ETH Whales Accumulated a Lot Last Week, But Now The Pace Decreased</h2>



<p>The number of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/goldman-sachs-regulatory-shift-bitcoin-ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum whales</a> holding at least 1,000 ETH has steadily increased since mid-November, rising from 5,534 on November 14 to 5,600 currently. This trend highlights consistent accumulation by large holders, which can provide valuable insights into market dynamics.</p>



<p>Tracking whale activity is essential as these entities often have the resources and information to influence market movements. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1800" height="1013" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/glassnode-studio_number-of-addresses-with-balance-1k.png" alt="Addresses with Balance &gt;= 1,000 ETH." class="wp-image-628195" style="aspect-ratio:16/9;object-fit:cover;width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/glassnode-studio_number-of-addresses-with-balance-1k.png 1800w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/glassnode-studio_number-of-addresses-with-balance-1k-360x203.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/glassnode-studio_number-of-addresses-with-balance-1k-850x478.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/glassnode-studio_number-of-addresses-with-balance-1k-768x432.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/glassnode-studio_number-of-addresses-with-balance-1k-1536x864.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/glassnode-studio_number-of-addresses-with-balance-1k-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Addresses with Balance &gt;= 1,000 ETH. Source: <a href="https://glassnode.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Glassnode</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Interestingly, the number of whales surged significantly between November 6 and November 10, coinciding with a 12.5% correction in <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/ethereum-price-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum price</a>. After peaking at 5,606 between November 11 and November 12, whale numbers have stabilized. </p>



<p>This stability suggests that major holders are no longer aggressively accumulating, which could indicate a period of consolidation for ETH price. Historically, such phases can precede a directional move, depending on whether broader sentiment leans bullish or bearish.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-eth-price-prediction-a-new-all-time-high-before-christimas">ETH Price Prediction: A New All-Time High Before Christimas?</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/vitalik-buterin-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a> price is currently trading within a range, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-price-4000-barrier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">facing resistance around $4,100</a> and finding support around $3,600. A recent crossover between two short-term trend lines hints at the potential for a new uptrend. </p>



<p>If this bullish signal materializes, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-bull-run-to-resume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ETH price</a> is likely to test the $4,100 resistance again. Even at that level, it would remain approximately 20% below its all-time high reached in 2021, suggesting room for further growth.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2710" height="1290" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ETHUSD_2024-12-13_09-50-38.png" alt="ETH Price Analysis." class="wp-image-628197" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ETHUSD_2024-12-13_09-50-38.png 2710w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ETHUSD_2024-12-13_09-50-38-360x171.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ETHUSD_2024-12-13_09-50-38-850x405.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ETHUSD_2024-12-13_09-50-38-768x366.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ETHUSD_2024-12-13_09-50-38-1536x731.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ETHUSD_2024-12-13_09-50-38-2048x975.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ETHUSD_2024-12-13_09-50-38-150x71.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2710px) 100vw, 2710px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">ETH Price Analysis.

<p>On the downside, if the current trend reverses into a downtrend and the $3,600 support fails to hold, ETH could retest $3,500. </p>



<p>A break below that level might lead to further declines, with $3,255 emerging as the next significant support. This scenario could delay any attempts to reclaim higher price levels.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Trending altcoins VELO, FARTCOIN, and AERO see gains amid renewed market interest. Will the bullish momentum sustain their rallies?</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://beincrypto.com/trending-altcoins-december-13/">Why These Altcoins Are Trending Today — December 13</a> appeared first on <a href="https://beincrypto.com">BeInCrypto</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>After several days of consolidation, altcoins seem to be gaining momentum, with several erasing some of their recent losses over the past 24 hours. Notably, two out of the three of today&#8217;s top trending altcoins — have seen their prices rise compared to yesterday.</strong></p>



<p>Interestingly, the reasons behind these price hikes for the two of them appear to be similar. According to CoinGecko data, these altcoins include Velodrome Finance (VELO), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), and Aerodrome Finance (AERO)</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-velodrome-finance-velo">Velodrome Finance (VELO)</h2>



<p>Velodrome Finance is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) built on the Optimism network. Its native token, VELO, is trending today because Binance announced it will be listed on the spot market, and it is part of the trending altcoins because of that.</p>



<p>Following the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/velodrome-vana-surge-on-binance-listing-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance announcement</a>, VELO’s price surged by 125% within a few hours. Before the disclosure, VELO’s price was less than $0.15. However, as of this writing, the value has increased to $0.33.</p>



<p>Besides that, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has increased, indicating bullish momentum around the cryptocurrency. Should buying pressure continue to increase, then VELO could rise as high as $0.44. On the flip side, if the altcoin holders decided to book profits off the hike, the trend might change, and its value could slide.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="3190" height="1802" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/velo-altcoins-trending-analysis.png" alt="VELO price analysis" class="wp-image-628096" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/velo-altcoins-trending-analysis.png 3190w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/velo-altcoins-trending-analysis-360x203.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/velo-altcoins-trending-analysis-850x480.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/velo-altcoins-trending-analysis-768x434.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/velo-altcoins-trending-analysis-1536x868.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/velo-altcoins-trending-analysis-2048x1157.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/velo-altcoins-trending-analysis-150x85.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 3190px) 100vw, 3190px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Velodrome Finance Daily Analysis.

<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading">Fartcoin (FARTCOIN)</h2>



<p>Fartcoin is one cryptocurrency that was on the trending altcoins list on December 12 and is back on the list today. Yesterday, BeInCrypto reported that the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-buy-solana-meme-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solana meme coin</a> exceeded a $500 million market cap, which made it a trending altcoin.</p>



<p>Today, thanks to a 25% price increase, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/fartcoin-hits-new-all-time-high/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the market cap has hi</a>t $655 million, suggesting that buying pressure around the token has continued to increase. On the daily chart, the altcoin seems to have found strong support around $0.20.</p>



<p>With no resistance in sight, it seems that the value might continue to climb. Should the trend continue, then <a href="https://beincrypto.com/trending-altcoins-december-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FARTCOIN’s price might rally</a> to $1 and probably hit a $1 billion market cap.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="3190" height="1802" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/fartcoin-price-analysis-altcoins.png" alt="FARTCOIN price analysis" class="wp-image-628091" style="aspect-ratio:1.7702552719200888;width:1023px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/fartcoin-price-analysis-altcoins.png 3190w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/fartcoin-price-analysis-altcoins-360x203.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/fartcoin-price-analysis-altcoins-850x480.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/fartcoin-price-analysis-altcoins-768x434.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/fartcoin-price-analysis-altcoins-1536x868.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/fartcoin-price-analysis-altcoins-2048x1157.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/fartcoin-price-analysis-altcoins-150x85.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 3190px) 100vw, 3190px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fartcoin Daily Analysis. Source: <a href="https://tradingview.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView  </a></figcaption></figure>



<p>On the other hand, if the broader meme coin market slumps, this might change. In that case, the value could decline to $0.34.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading">Aerodrome Finance (AERO)</h2>



<p>For those who have been following the market for a while, it might be surprising that AERO is trending the same as VELO. Aerodrome Finance was developed by the same team that created Velodrome. But instead of building the Aerodrome AMM on Optimism, it operates on <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-base-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Base</a>, which is Coinbase layer-2 network.</p>



<p>Therefore, Aerodrom Finance is part of the trending altcoin because its sister token was listed on Binance. But unlike VELO, AERO’s price decreased by 2.50% in the last 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the technical outlook, the Money Flow Index (MFI) on the AERO 4-hour chart shows an increased reading.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="3190" height="1802" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/aerodrome-aero-price-analysis.png" alt="AERO altcoins price analysis" class="wp-image-628089" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/aerodrome-aero-price-analysis.png 3190w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/aerodrome-aero-price-analysis-360x203.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/aerodrome-aero-price-analysis-850x480.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/aerodrome-aero-price-analysis-768x434.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/aerodrome-aero-price-analysis-1536x868.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/aerodrome-aero-price-analysis-2048x1157.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/aerodrome-aero-price-analysis-150x85.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 3190px) 100vw, 3190px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Aerodrome Finance 4-Hour Analysis. Source: <a href="https://tradingview.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a> </figcaption></figure>



<p>The rise in the MFI reading indicates rising buying pressure. If bulls sustain this pressure, the altcoin’s value might close in on $3. But if the buying pressure subsides, the value could sink to $1.79.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>During a phase of price consolidation and increasing bearish sentiment, large XRP investors, known as &#8220;whales,&#8221; have been actively accumulating the cryptocurrency.</strong></p>



<p>This accumulation reflects sustained confidence in XRP&#8217;s long-term potential among major holders. The trend could set the stage for a breakout, enabling XRP to target its multi-year high of $2.90.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-whales-fill-their-bags"><strong>XRP Whales Fill Their Bags</strong></h2>



<p>Over the past week, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/xrp-bullish-momentum-fades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XRP has traded within a narrow range</a>. Its price has faced resistance at $2.62 and has found support at $2.20. As of this writing, the altcoin exchanges hands at $2.34, hovering above this key support level.</p>



<p>XRP’s sideways movement and waning bullish sentiment have prompted a group of large investors who hold between <a href="https://beincrypto.com/xrp-faces-setback-as-profit-taking-rises/">100 million and 1 billion XRP tokens</a> to seize the opportunity to accumulate a significant amount of the cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Per Santiment, this cohort of investors has collectively added approximately 590 million XRP to their holdings over the past seven days, translating to a value of around $1.29 billion. Currently, this group of XRP investors holds 8.91 billion tokens.</p>

<p>This trend of whale accumulation signals strong confidence in XRP’s future price. As large holders accumulate more XRP, it can create upward pressure on the market, leading to potential price rallies as smaller investors react to the activity.</p>



<p>Despite XRP&#8217;s limited price movements, derivatives traders remain optimistic about a rally, as evidenced by the altcoin&#8217;s positive funding rate, currently at 0.008%.</p>



<p>The funding rate represents the periodic fee exchanged between traders to align the contract price with the spot price. A positive funding rate indicates that long position holders are paying short position holders, reflecting a market bias toward bullish sentiment.</p>

<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-price-prediction-why-accumulation-must-continue"><strong>XRP Price Prediction: Why Accumulation Must Continue</strong></h2>



<p>XRP is trading at $2.34, holding slightly above the support level at $2.20. If retail investors increase their accumulation, the price could rise toward the resistance at $2.62. A successful breakout above this level may push XRP to $2.90, a high last seen in 2018.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has shifted its focus to Bitcoin and Ethereum, opting to bypass the launch of any new altcoin-based Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).</strong></p>



<p>The firm&#8217;s Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETFs, IBIT and ETHA, respectively, have shown significant performance milestones this year.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-stellar-performance-fuels-strategic-focus-for-blackrock-s-ibit-and-etha"><strong>Stellar Performance Fuels Strategic Focus for BlackRock’s IBIT and ETHA</strong></h2>



<p>Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reported the stance, citing Jay Jacobs, the head of BlackRock&#8217;s ETF department. He said that BlackRock does not plan to launch any new altcoin-focused ETFs. Jacobs also emphasized the company&#8217;s intention to concentrate on expanding the reach of its existing Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which have performed exceptionally well so far.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote">
<p>“We’re just at the tip of the iceberg with Bitcoin and especially Ethereum. Just a tiny fraction of our clients own IBIT and ETHA, so that’s what we’re focused on (vs. launching new altcoin ETFs),” Jay Jacobs reportedly <a href="https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1867315163566629059" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The statement highlights BlackRock’s strategy to deepen its foothold in the cryptocurrency market through its flagship ETFs, as opposed to diversifying into smaller altcoins like Solana (SOL) or Ripple’s XRP.</p>



<p>Indeed, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has been a standout performer, recently <a href="https://beincrypto.com/blackrocks-ibit-etf-europe-surpass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassing over 50 European funds combined</a> in trading volume. Meanwhile, its Ethereum ETF <a href="https://beincrypto.com/blackrock-etha-billion-etf-club/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joined the prestigious $1 billion ETF club</a> within just two months of launch. Taken together, these milestones display the increasing institutional appetite for these digital assets.</p>



<p>Against this backdrop, BlackRock’s success has been widely recognized. Its Bitcoin ETF was recently named the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/blackrock-fidelity-bitcoin-etfs-top-performers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top performer of the decade</a> alongside Fidelity’s FBTC.</p>



<p>These achievements align with BlackRock’s cautious approach to the broader crypto space. Earlier this year, the firm confirmed that it was not pursuing a Solana ETF despite market buzz. In late July, BlackRock’s digital asset head Robert Mitchnick cast further <a href="https://beincrypto.com/blackrock-no-immediate-solana-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubt on the immediate viability of Solana ETFs</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote">
<p>“I don’t think we’re going to see a long list of crypto ETFs. If you think of Bitcoin, today it represents about 55% of the market cap. Ethereum is at 18%. The next plausible investible asset is at, like, 3%. It’s just not close to being at that threshold or track record of maturity, liquidity, etc.,” Mitchnick <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/307644/there-wont-be-a-long-list-of-crypto-etfs-blackrocks-robert-mitchnick-says" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Meanwhile, BlackRock’s skepticism on XRP ETF likely stems from the ongoing <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/ripple-vs-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regulatory uncertainty surrounding the token</a>. By focusing on Bitcoin and Ethereum, the asset manager appears to be doubling down on assets with proven resilience and market appeal.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-market-expectations-for-altcoin-etfs"><strong>Market Expectations for Altcoin ETFs</strong></h2>



<p>BlackRock’s cautious stance on altcoins aligns with its overall conservative investment philosophy, which is displayed in its <a href="https://beincrypto.com/vaneck-endorses-bitcoin-reserve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hesitance to endorse a Bitcoin reserve</a>. Nevertheless, the firm has been vocal about Bitcoin&#8217;s role in institutional pockets, advocating for the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/blackrock-bitcoin-portfolio-allocation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allocation of up to 2% of portfolios to BTC</a>. This mirrors its confidence in the asset’s long-term potential.</p>



<p>Although BlackRock remains uninterested in launching altcoin ETFs, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/trumps-win-influence-experts-weigh-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">analysts expect the US regulatory playing to change under Donald Trump</a>. Some predict that ETFs for assets like Solana and XRP could receive approval by the end of 2025.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote">
<p>“The greatest Solana win coming from the new Trump Presidency will be our long-awaited ETF in 2025 or 2026. No surprise, the incredible VanEck team will lead the charge here with support from 21Shares and Canary Capital,”&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/DanJablonski_/status/1854222437333811309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>&nbsp;Dan Jablonski, head of growth at news and research firm Syndica.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>BlackRock’s potential shift toward entering altcoin-based markets likely depends on achieving regulatory clarity, which could drive significant demand. Meanwhile, Mike Venuto, co-founder of Tidal Financial Group, provided perspective on the broader ETF market, as noted by Balchunas.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote">
<p>“We have people coming to us all the time trying to pitch ‘Bitcoin + something else’ ETFs. Every options strategy you can think of is going to be tied to Bitcoin, Nvidia, Tesla, and MicroStrategy in ETFs. It’s coming,” Balchunas <a href="https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1867316688880120175" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a>, citing Venuto.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>BlackRock’s record-breaking success with its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs underscores its strategic focus and alignment with market demand. While other firms explore altcoin ETFs, BlackRock’s dedication to expanding its existing offerings positions it as a leader in shaping the future of institutional crypto investments.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Despite a slight downturn in the broader cryptocurrency market, several altcoins have bucked the trend, hitting new all-time highs today.</strong></p>



<p>BeInCrypto has analyzed three standout tokens, with Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) leading the charge.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-fartcoin-fartcoin"><strong>Fartcoin (FARTCOIN)</strong></h2>



<p>Meme coin FARTCOIN surged to a new all-time high of $0.73 during the early Asian session on Friday. It is now trading at $0.63, reflecting a 12% decline from its peak.</p>



<p>Today’s all-time high is the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/fartcoin-hits-new-all-time-high/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sixth in seven days</a>, reflecting the steady uptick in the altcoin&#8217;s demand, mostly fueled by meme coin mania. The setup of FARTCOIN’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) confirms this bullish outlook.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At press time, its MACD line (blue) lies above its signal line (orange). When this momentum indicator is set up this way, it suggests a bullish trend. It indicates that the asset&#8217;s price may continue to rise. This crossover is often seen as a signal to buy, reflecting increased buying pressure. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2770" height="1360" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FARTCOINUSDT_2024-12-13_10-47-21.png" alt="FARTCOIN Price Analysis" class="wp-image-628030" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FARTCOINUSDT_2024-12-13_10-47-21.png 2770w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FARTCOINUSDT_2024-12-13_10-47-21-360x177.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FARTCOINUSDT_2024-12-13_10-47-21-850x417.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FARTCOINUSDT_2024-12-13_10-47-21-768x377.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FARTCOINUSDT_2024-12-13_10-47-21-1536x754.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FARTCOINUSDT_2024-12-13_10-47-21-2048x1006.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FARTCOINUSDT_2024-12-13_10-47-21-150x74.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2770px) 100vw, 2770px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">FARTCOIN Price Analysis. Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>If this trend persists, FARTCOIN’s price will reclaim its all-time high and rally past it.&nbsp;On the other hand, the meme coin’s price may drop to $0.56 if selling pressure spikes.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-fasttoken-ftn"><strong>Fasttoken (FTN)</strong></h2>



<p>Fasttoken (FTN) is the native cryptocurrency of the layer-1 blockchain platform Bahamut. It rose to an all-time high of $3.26 today. While its price has since dropped by 1%, the token continues to enjoy a significant bullish bias.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is confirmed by its rising Chaikin Money Flow (CMF). As of this writing, FTN’s CMF is at 0.71.</p>



<p>The CMF indicator measures the accumulation and distribution of an asset over a specified period, typically 21 days. When the CMF is above zero, the asset is experiencing more buying pressure than selling pressure, suggesting a bullish trend. This positive reading often signals a potential upward price movement.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2770" height="1360" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FTNUSDT_2024-12-13_10-55-48.png" alt="FTN Price Analysis" class="wp-image-628036" style="aspect-ratio:2.038369304556355;width:1021px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FTNUSDT_2024-12-13_10-55-48.png 2770w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FTNUSDT_2024-12-13_10-55-48-360x177.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FTNUSDT_2024-12-13_10-55-48-850x417.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FTNUSDT_2024-12-13_10-55-48-768x377.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FTNUSDT_2024-12-13_10-55-48-1536x754.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FTNUSDT_2024-12-13_10-55-48-2048x1006.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/FTNUSDT_2024-12-13_10-55-48-150x74.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2770px) 100vw, 2770px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">FTN Price Analysis. Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>If the rally persists, FTN will reclaim its all-time high of $3.26, possibly flip it into a support floor and rise further.&nbsp;Conversely, if profit-taking activity spikes, the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/altcoins-crypto-whales-bought-first-week-december/">altcoin’s value</a> will plummet to $2.67.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-gigachad-giga"><strong>Gigachad (GIGA)</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/5-meme-coins-to-watch-in-december/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solana-based meme coin</a> GIGA hit an all-time high of $0.080 earlier today. It has since witnessed an 8% pullback causing it to trade at $0.074 at press time.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, token accumulation persists among market participants, as reflected by GIGA’s rising Relative Strength Index (RSI). At the time of writing, this is at 66.23.</p>



<p>An asset’s RSI indicator measures its overbought and oversold conditions. Its values range between 0 and 100, with values above 70 indicating that the asset is overbought and due for a correction. On the other hand, values under 30 suggest that the asset is oversold and may witness a rebound.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Aptos Foundation, a leading global blockchain entity, has announced the opening of its new office in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), reinforcing the UAE’s status as a hub for blockchain and Web3 innovation. </strong></p>



<p>This strategic move aims to foster regional partnerships, accelerate blockchain adoption, and expand the Aptos ecosystem.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-adgm-a-magnet-for-blockchain-leaders"><strong>ADGM: A Magnet for Blockchain Leaders</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/uae-new-tax-exemption-crypto-boom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The UAE has emerged as a global leader</a> in blockchain and Web3 adoption, creating a favorable environment for innovation. <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/buy-aptos-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aptos</a> Foundation’s Abu Dhabi office will act as a regional hub to collaborate with developers, institutions, and investors. This expansion underlines the foundation’s commitment to accelerating blockchain integration worldwide.</p>



<p>Bashar Lazaar, Head of Grants and Ecosystems at Aptos Foundation, emphasized the region’s progressive stance on Web3. </p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote">
<p>“The UAE is leaning hard into Web3, making Abu Dhabi a clear leader in blockchain worldwide. This opening provides a unique opportunity for our team to learn from and connect on the ground with cutting-edge builders, institutions, and investors pushing the boundaries every day,” Lazaar <a href="https://www.adgm.com/media/announcements/aptos-foundation-expands-global-footprint-with-new-abu-dhabi-office/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Arvind Ramamurthy, Chief Market Development Officer at ADGM, welcomed the Aptos Foundation’s entry.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote">
<p>“Their decision to establish their first foreign office here highlights the UAE’s leadership in fostering innovation and advancing blockchain technologies. We look forward to the contributions they will make to our vibrant community and the broader region,&#8221; Ramamurthy said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>ADGM has gained recognition for its <a href="https://beincrypto.com/uae-introduces-legal-framework-for-daos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blockchain-friendly regulatory framework</a>, attracting major players in the industry. Along with Aptos, ADGM has attracted many blockchain leaders.</p>



<p>For instance, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ton-foundation-blockchain-expansion-abu-dhabi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TON Foundation recently registered</a> under ADGM’s Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) Foundations framework, targeting MENA and APAC regions. Moreover, Steve Yun, President of the TON Foundation, described the milestone as pivotal for collaboration with regional stakeholders and fostering blockchain trust.</p>



<p>Similarly, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/abu-dhabis-adgm-chainlink/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chainlink Labs established operations in ADGM</a>, positioning itself to meet the rising demand for decentralized finance solutions in the Middle East. Polygon Labs also joined the ADGM ecosystem, focusing on transparency and international disclosure standards. </p>



<p>The UAE’s leadership in fostering blockchain technologies stems from forward-thinking government policies and a strong financial infrastructure. ADGM’s regulatory clarity and emphasis on innovation have also drawn entities like Tether, whose stablecoin, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/tether-usdt-approved-adgm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USDT, now serves as an accepted virtual asset</a> in the financial ecosystem.</p>



<p>Due to the crypto-friendly approach, the UAE has a significant adoption rate. According to Statista, as of July 2024, there is 39.13% crypto penetration in the UAE.</p>
